# Application Selection Procedure

We aim to have 100 participants, targeting **master students, early PhD students or Junior faculty**, with at least 50 of them being RAS student members. To achieve this, we will give preference to RAS student members during the selection process and subsequently to individuals who share relevant interests. In particular, we will select the participants according to the following:

- The applications are processed on a rolling basis (with 15-20 days of intervals).
- We will stop receiving applications once we have reached our capacity limit.
- We will discard out of scope participants (e.g. fake participants).
- We will split the applications into 4 groups: (1) regular participants, (2) participants eligible for financial support, (3) RAS student members, and (4) local participants.
- We will prioritize participants from groups (3), (2) & (4) (in that order) and select randomly.
- Finally, we will select which participants receive financial support after carefully examining the submitted applications.


# Eligibility for Travel Awards/Fee Waivers

In order to enhance diversity within our community and make the summer school more accessible, we will offer several scholarships aimed at reducing the cost of participation for attendees. **In particular, 15% of all sponsorship funds will be allocated to waiving registration and lodging fees for participants from under-represented groups.** We will prioritize students who affiliate with:

- Underrepresented groups: women, underrepresented minorities, first-generation college students, LGBTQ+
- People with disabilities
- People who have stepped down from the field for some time and want to return (e.g., due to a disease or parental leave)
- Secondary/undergrad/graduate students interested in robotics or automation topics who face barriers to attendance at major conferences

If you fall into one of these categories, please choose tha appropriate fields in the application form.

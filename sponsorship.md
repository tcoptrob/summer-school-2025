## Funding Model and Sponsorship Levels
The summer school will be funded by registration fees collected from the participants and financial support from our sponsors. The registration fees will cover the costs for accommodation, meals, transportation to the venue, etc. for every participant. The funds from our sponsors will be used for supporting travel of our invited speakers, hardware platform used for teaching, remaining organizational costs, and to defray the costs of student attendance. **In particular, 15% of all sponsorship funds will be allocated to waiving registration and lodging fees for participants from under-represented groups.**

Sponsors will gain targeted publicity through our event, networking and engagement opportunities with the upcoming talent in robotics. We offer various packages for sponsorship.

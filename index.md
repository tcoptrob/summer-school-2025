Optimization algorithms form the bedrock of much of robotics, from machine learning to control, state estimation, and simulation. However, the research literature on these topics is vast and different communities often use different notation and terminology to describe similar ideas, making it difficult to see the deep connections between these areas. 

**The overall goal is to provide roboticists with a deeper understanding of the connections between seemingly disparate topics and to motivate the cross-pollination of ideas across subfields. No specialized background in optimization is expected of attendees.** All content will also be posted online and released as open-source after the summer school for the benefit of the robotics community.

The Optimization for Robotics Summer School will cover:
1. A grounding in the fundamental mathematics and numerical algorithms of optimization.
2. A selection of robotics topics, including learning, control, state estimation, and simulation, from a unified optimization perspective.
3. Instructor-guided hands-on coding exercises to gain practical experience.

**Targeted Attendance:** 100 master students, PhD students or early career researchers/faculty

**Attendee Cost:**
+ Registration without accommodation:
   + ~~Early-bird (until April 1st 2025): €350~~
   + ~~Standard: €450~~
   + ~~Late/On-site: €500~~
+ Travel awards and/or fee waivers will be given to selected students

 See the [Applicant Selection Procedure]({{ "/application" | relative_url }}) for details.

 **Update:** We are fully booked! Thank you for your interest!
<!-- + Registration with accommodation: €650-800 -->

### Venue & Social Events

All the activities (except for the dinner) of the summer school will happen in the [**Conference & Cultural Center of the University of Patras**](http://www.confer.upatras.gr/abouten.php). More details about the social events and the venue can be found [here]({{ "/logistics" | relative_url }}).

### Schedule
Each day will consist of a mix of background on key topics, hands-on examples both in software and with select hardware deployments, and research talks from leaders in the field.

**Schedule Overview**

A schedule overview follows in the table. The full detailed schedule is available [**here**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UsML7kxi9HQ4M8Hh9mxuN4EcK6snoWDQ9gaC0X3tabo).
